Repo Project 2
Python Implimentation of RPG Game
Code Description: Code Description: I am writing code that will create an RPG game called "The Fun House" that takes place in a house. In this house there are three rooms that a user can enter. Upon entering the rooms, the user is presented with a challenge specific to that room. The user can continue trying to pass these rooms, and once he does he has beaten the game.
Upon beating the game the user can decide to quit out of the game, otherwise he can roam around the house until he'd like to quit.
